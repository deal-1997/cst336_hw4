                  <p> C++ is a general-purpose programming 
            language that is very popular to use and is
            one of the easiest language to adapt too. 
            Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++. The language 
            has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now 
            has object-oriented, generic, and functional 
            features in addition to facilities for 
            low-level memory manipulation. It is almost 
            always implemented as a compiled language, and 
            many vendors provide C++ compilers. Many popular
            companies that use C++ are LinkedIn, Facebook, Microsoft,
            and NASA. C++ is a unique language that it can be used
            for about anything.</p>
